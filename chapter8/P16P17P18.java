/*
P8.16
Reimplement the CashRegister class so that it keeps track of the price
of each added item in an ArrayList<Double>.
Remove the itemCount and totalPrice instance variables.
Reimplement the clear, addItem, getTotal, and getCount methods. Add a method
displayAll that displays the prices of all items in the current sale.

P8.17 Reimplement the CashRegister class so that
it keeps track of the total price as an integer:
the total cents of the price.
For example, instead of storing 17.29, store the
integer 1729.
 Such an implementation is commonly used because it avoids the accumulation
of roundoff errors. Do not change the public interface of the class.

P8.18 After closing time, the store manager would like to know how much business was
transacted during the day. Modify the CashRegister class to enable this functionality.
Supply methods getSalesTotal and getSalesCount to get the total amount of all sales
and the number of sales. Supply a method resetSales that resets any counters and
totals so that the next dayâ€™s sales start from zero.
