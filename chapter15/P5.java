/*
15.5 A homeowner rents out parking spaces in a driveway during special events.
The driveway is a "last-in, first-out" stack.
 Of course, when a car owner retrieves a vehicle that wasnâ€™t the last one in,
 the cars blocking it must temporarily move to the street so
 that the requested vehicle can leave. Write a program that models this
behavior, using one stack for the driveway and one stack for the street.
Use integers as license plate numbers.
Positive numbers add a car, negative numbers remove a car, zero stops the simulation.
Print out the stack after each operation is complete.
