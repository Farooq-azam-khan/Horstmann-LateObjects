P16.31 Add methods to count collisions to the hash set in Section 16.4 and the one in
Exercise P16.30. Insert all words from a dictionary (which you can find in /usr/
share/dict/words on a UNIX or Linux computer) into both hash set implementations.
Does the MAD method reduce collisions? (Use a table size that equals the number
of words in the file. Choose p to be the next prime greater than L, a = 3, and b = 5.)
